GlusterFS is a flexible, powerful, POSIX-compliant cluster filesystem
that can scale to several petabytes.

GlusterFS works over either TCP/IP or high-performance Infiniband
RDMA interconnect.

GlusterFS provides striping and on-the-fly synchronous replication
of files. GlusterFS has a fully distributed design, with no single
point of failure.
